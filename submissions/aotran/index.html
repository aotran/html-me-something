        <p>I am getting married in October. As a girl, I never gave much thought to
        my wedding day. (Frankly, as an adult I haven't given much thought to it
        either.) The thought of walking down an aisle in a froofy white dress fills
        me with dread.</p>

        <p>Luckily, I can forgo at least one part of the traditional western-style
        wedding since I happen to have been born a Chinese woman. (No need to cry
        about appropriation of another culture.)</p>

        <p>The traditional Chinese dress is called a "cheongsam" or "qipao." It was
        first popularized in the 1920s. A cheongsam is distinguished by its mandarin
        collar and form-fitting. Typically, they are body length with leg slits
        on each side. They can be made with many different materials, with more
        traditional styles in silk and cheaper versions in polyester satin.</p>

        <header><h3>Silk brocade</h3></header>
        <p>Silk brocade is a fabric made of silk which has patterns woven into it. The
        patterns can be in different colors, though I prefer a more subtle look as
        shown in this example.</p>
